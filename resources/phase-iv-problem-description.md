# Phase IV Problem Description
The following is a continuation of the system you are being tasked to develop.  The system requirements – explicit and implicit – are being continued from the earlier assignment(s), with designated additional requirements and clarifications.  You have been tasked to design an object-oriented system (to be implemented in Java) that meets these requirements and provides these functional and non-functional capabilities.

The most important aspect of this phase of the project: no new requirements(!).  Quite simply, you have the opportunity to build on all of your work to this point and select two (2) design changes that you believe will have a significant and positive impact on the structure of your system.

# Assignment Deliverables
This is a Group Assignment - please submit the following deliverables as one team.  Please upload the PDF documents to Canvas.  Your team needs to provide three (3) deliverables for this assignment:

[1] The first deliverable is a repository of working Java Source Code that implements the two (2) approved design changes that you have selected.  Though you may do some of your design and development on other platforms (e.g., a "local" laptop), you must publish your solution in the GT Github repository that you created in the earlier assignments.

[2] The second deliverable is a brief report that provides more details about your selected design changes.  You are allowed to use a combination of text and any official UML diagrams to help make your case.  Your description can be between one to six (1-6) pages long, including diagrams.  You have some flexibility in how you present your materials, but your report must address the following issues:

Description: A clear and concise description of the two (2) system improvements that you've implemented
Scope: The scope of these changes (i.e., packages, classes, attributes, operations and methods, lines of codes, etc.)
Background: Documentation for these changes (i.e., which texts, references, or other resource materials did you consult)
Findings: One or two examples of how your changes have improved the design of your system - for example, an example of how a specific type of new requirements might have taken numerous changes across multiple files in the "before version" of the system, and how those same changes are now more manageable in the "after version" of the system.
[3] A 20-minute presentation of your work and findings on one of the designated Class Presentation Days.  We will solicit preferences for those dates and times.  You will be welcome to use the projector and provide a persuasive and compelling argument about the merits of your changes.

# How We Will Evaluate Your Submission
We will evaluate your submission based on these factors:

[1] Design: Is your code structured using object-oriented best practices and patterns?

The structure of your system must reflect a solid object-oriented structure, to include using principles and patterns such as: the General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns (GRASP) in the Craig Larman text; the SOLID Principles from Robert Martin (i.e., "Uncle Bob"); and, design patterns similar to those from the "Gang of Four" Book.

[2] Consistency: Are your design artifacts consistent with your source code?

The classes in your Design Class Diagram must match the classes in your source code in terms of attributes, data types, parameters, cardinalities, methods, navigation aspects, accessibility (e.g., public/protected/private), etc.  Also, the behavior of your flyDrone() functionality described by your Sequence Diagram must match the operational behavior of your source code as well.  The messages between objects, values returned, parameters passed, along with the selection and iteration structures used, must be reflected with the appropriately labeled solid and dotted arrows, properly sequenced and nested alt and loop boxes, etc.  And all diagrams must use clear, correct and consistent notation per the class slides and/or the Larman text.

[3] Correctness: Does your source code work correctly with respect to the problem description and requirements?

The main functionality tests will be against the "logically-oriented" errors described in the earlier assignments.  And even without any new requirements, you must ensure that your system still generates the correct responses, and that your design improvements haven't compromised the integrity of the system.
